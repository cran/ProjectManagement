\title{Early time for a deterministic projects}
\usage{
early.time(precedence, duration)
}
\arguments{
\item{precedence}{a matrix that indicates the order of precedence between activities.  If the value \eqn{(i,j)} is equal to 1 then \eqn{i} precedes \eqn{j}.}

\item{duration}{vector with the duraci√≥n for each activities.}
}
\value{
Early time vector.
}
\description{
This function calculates the early time for one project.
}
\examples{
precedence<-matrix(c(0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0),nrow=5,ncol=5,byrow=TRUE)
