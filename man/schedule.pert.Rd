\title{Schedule for deterministic projects}
\usage{
schedule.pert(duration, precedence, PRINT = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{duration}{Vector with the duraci√≥n for each activity.}

\item{precedence}{A matrix that indicates the order of precedence between activities.  If the value \eqn{(i,j)} is equal to 1 then \eqn{i} precedes \eqn{j}.}

\item{PRINT}{Logical indicator to show the schedule represented in a graph (Default=TRUE)}
}
\value{
A list of a project schedule and if PRINT=TRUE a plot of schedule.
}
\description{
This function calculates the duration of the project, the slacks for each activity, as well as the schedule of each activity.
